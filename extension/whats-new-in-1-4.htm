If you are signed in to Chrome using your Google account, your settings are automatically synced to your account across all instances of Chrome that you use. If you are not signed in then the settings will only exist locally on that instance of Chrome.

It is now possible to import and export deadbolt settings, and you should consider doing this for the following reasons:

- It enables you to copy your settings onto a computer that you are not signed in to (e.g. a work computer).
- If you ever removed the extension, but decided to add it again at a later date you can simply import your existingn settings.
- As with all electronic data, you should always have a backup, just in case.

It only takes a few seconds, and you can find the export button on the top right hand side of the settings page.
